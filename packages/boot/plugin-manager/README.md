# @deepseek-ai/dsh-plugin-manager

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Application-owned profiles supply their bundled package-manager invocation through launcher facts. It takes precedence over `pnpmCommand` for package operations and registry inspection; its environment applies only to those subprocesses.

## Summary

Manage the current profile's plugins without editing configuration by hand. Enable or disable individual plugin entries, select installed bundles, and install or remove external bundles. With HMR enabled in YAML, configuration changes apply immediately; without HMR, the running composition remains until restart. Changes affect every session using the profile.

## Use this package

Base-backed profiles provide the manager. In Web, the sidebar's **Plugins** page ([ui-plugin-manager](../../client/ui-plugin-manager/README.md)) manages the profile's bundles and their uniquely addressable rows; the Settings Plugin list stays read-only. Agent-preset rows remain read-only. The `plugin_manager` tool exposes the same operations and is enabled in Creator mode. Other presets keep it disabled by default. Every tool action requires `danger-full-access` or approval for that call. Under lower sandbox modes, `ask` requests approval; `never`, rejection, cancellation, or an unavailable approval channel prevents execution. An approval leaves the session permission mode unchanged. Profile changes persist across sessions, and installed Host code executes in-process outside the workspace sandbox. Dependency build-script approval remains separate.

For a deployment without agent presets, enable the tool in the profile patch. Preset-backed sessions use their preset’s `tool-plugin-manager` entry.

```yaml
- id: tool-plugin-manager
  disabled: false
```

A plugin toggle updates only `disabled` in the last matching override in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, or appends an override when none matches. Matching uses the entry id and any module-name assertion. A bundle toggle changes `package.json`'s ordered `dsh.profile.bundles` list. Disabling retains the dependency; enabling appends the bundle at the end, which can change configuration precedence. Installation enables a new bundle by default. Home and invocation patches retain their higher priority.

`inspect(spec)` reads what a spec names before anything installs: a registry name is asked of the registry through `pnpm view`, run in the profile directory so the same registry and proxy settings apply as to the install; an absolute path has its `package.json` read; a git address or tarball answers only its form. The answer carries the name, version, description, and whether the package declares a bundle, or a `problem`: `invalid-spec`, `already-installed`, `not-found`, `not-a-package`, `not-a-bundle`, `network`, or `unknown`. A caller's `signal` or `inspectTimeoutMs` ends the lookup.

`installBundle` accepts a caller-generated `requestId`, under which `plugin-manager/install-log` streams each pnpm run's output and `plugin-manager/install-state` announces `installing`, `cancelling`, and `applying`. `cancelInstall(requestId)` stops the run and answers `cancelled` only after pnpm exited and the files are back, `too-late` once the bundle is being applied, and `not-running` for any other id; the install call then reports `application: 'cancelled'`. A run that fails, is cancelled, or adds a package without a bundle patch restores `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` as they were; `packageResult.kind` classifies a failed run from its exit and output, and `bundle` names the package a finished run added. `listBundles` carries each bundle's one-liner (the package `description`), the rows its patch declares with their live entries, and the built-in rows it overrides; it lists the profile's own bundles, the bundles the installation supplies, and a selected name without a bundle patch as a `not-bundle` problem, while an unselected plain dependency is left out. A bundle the launcher's `OPTIONAL_BUNDLES` names is `optional`: shipped switched off for the person to turn on, never removable, and selected by no shipped template ([rationale](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-15-shipped-optional-bundles.md)). Every completed operation emits `plugin-manager/changed`; a patch generation applied outside the manager, by HMR's watcher after a CLI or hand edit, announces nothing, so the page learns of it on its next read.

When pnpm 11 blocks dependency scripts, the failed installation reports every pending package name in the profile under `pendingBuilds`, including names left by earlier attempts; a failed run restores `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` but deliberately not `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, where pnpm records them. The Web plugin page offers **Allow these scripts and retry**; the tool can grant permission on the user's behalf through `approvedBuilds` on `install_bundle`, after the user approves those scripts in the conversation. The service validates pending names; it does not verify conversation approval. Approval persists by package name in this profile, permits commands with the host user's permissions, and survives another installation failure. Only currently undecided names can be approved; existing denials and wildcard rules cannot be overridden through this action. Approval rejects YAML anchors or aliases inside `allowBuilds`. Retry preserves the original activation choice.

### Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpmCommand` | `pnpm` | The pnpm executable name or path, resolved through `PATH` like the `dsh plugin` command. |
| `inspectTimeoutMs` | `20000` | Bound on one registry lookup an inspection runs, in milliseconds. |
| `outputBytes` | `16384` | Maximum pnpm diagnostic bytes returned per operation; the full output remains in the returned log path. |
| `lockWaitMs` | `120000` | Maximum time in milliseconds to acquire the profile write lock. |

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The service and `dsh plugin` share the package operations in [operations.ts](src/operations.ts). The launcher supplies the current profile; [DSH HMR](../hmr/README.md) serializes module reloads, file watching and management writes. Each refresh re-reads bundle selection and patch layers, updates the original root Include, and awaits removed plugin resources as well as the remaining Loader tree. CLI and service operations share the profile manifest writer lock to prevent concurrent package and manifest writes. HMR does not acquire that lock. Pnpm runs outside the HMR queue; installation selects the bundle after pnpm succeeds, while removal deselects and unloads the bundle before pnpm runs. Dependency-only changes do not trigger configuration reloads.

Results contain the last attempted stage, target, saved-state change, application status and error codes. Web dictionaries render management text; pnpm and Loader diagnostics remain unmodified. Unrelated pre-existing inactive entries return warnings; new or changed failures and inactive explicit enablement targets fail the operation. A failed or cancelled installation restores the manifest and lockfile it snapshotted before pnpm ran ([rationale](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-15-guided-plugin-installation.md)); a failed removal retains its partial changes and diagnostics. Installations are tracked by request id until their call settles, so a cancellation names one run and joins its settlement without taking the profile lock. The CLI inherits authentication variables and terminal descriptors; service operations use a scrubbed environment and captured output. No invariant companion is published because the manager reads files and Loader state directly and owns no independent state projection.

## Model Experience

### Management tool

#### What the model sees

The [`plugin_manager` tool](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-plugin-manager) lists plugin entries and bundles and performs profile-wide changes. Its results include saved-state changes, application status and package diagnostics. Management operations do not inject messages into Agents.

#### Token effect

The tool declaration is present when its consumer is mounted; each invocation adds its returned inventory or change result.

#### KV Cache effect

Tool results append to the transcript. Enabling or disabling other tools can change subsequent tool declarations and their cache reuse.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- Web approves the entire displayed pending group; it has no per-package selection.
- Package replacements require restarting the process to load a fresh JavaScript module generation.
- Startup-only profiles cannot remove packages used to start the current process; stop it and use `dsh plugin`.
- The manager cannot disable its own management components, change another profile, or edit an agent preset's composition.
- A failed removal may leave dependencies partially changed, and a failed or cancelled installation can leave downloaded files under `node_modules` or the pnpm store. Inactive dependencies with missing files remain removable. Diagnostic logs remain under the profile's `.plugin-manager/logs` directory.
- Management results describe Host activation. Browser synchronization failures appear separately in the Settings plugin list.
- Desktop package operations remain owned by the Desktop shell.

<a id="failure-behavior"></a>
### Failure behavior

Failures preserve completed steps and report the actual remaining state. Profile dependencies without valid bundle metadata remain visible and removable, with enablement unavailable.

| Failed operation | Handling |
|---|---|
| Install: pnpm or bundle validation fails | Restore `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` as snapshotted before pnpm ran; files pnpm downloaded may remain. Report installation failure. |
| Enable: saving selection or loading fails | Keep the installed dependency and any saved selection. Report enablement failure; allow repair, disablement or removal. |
| Remove: any step fails | Stop at the failed step. Preserve completed changes, retain remaining dependencies for retry, and report removal failure. Do not re-enable the bundle. |

Installation finishes after pnpm and bundle validation succeed; subsequent enablement failure does not undo installation. Removal proceeds in order: remove the bundle from `dsh.profile.bundles`, unload its runtime contributions, then run `pnpm remove`. A failed step prevents subsequent steps.

Restoration rewrites only the two snapshotted files; user-authored patch configuration, application data, diagnostic logs and files pnpm downloaded remain untouched, and the next package operation prunes packages no manifest references.
