 * Implementations must honor these semantics:
 * - {@link run} rejects only for infrastructure failures. Nonzero exits,
 *   timeout kills, and abort kills resolve with a {@link ShellRunResult}.
 * - {@link start} resolves after launch preparation; cancellation or setup failure
 *   rejects before publishing a handle. No timeout applies to background processes.
 *   Once published, `done` settles at process close and never rejects; subprocess
 *   provider failures settle as `killed` with the error on stderr.
 * - {@link ShellProcess.readOutput} is incremental: consecutive reads never
 *   repeat output. Lossy reads report truncation and available spill files.
 * - A still-running background process is stopped and awaited when its
 *   owning composition tears down. With the subprocess seam that
 *   boundary is `ctx.subprocess` disposal, so a background process survives
 *   an executor-only reload.
