- **Start with minimal context:** expose purpose, available actions, and constraints first; load detailed instructions when needed.
- **Make discovery explicit:** every deferred resource needs a clear description and a reliable way to retrieve it.
- **Keep critical constraints visible:** permissions, destructive effects, and required validation should appear before the relevant action.
- **Prefer bounded outputs:** return concise results with identifiers or paths for retrieving details; avoid dumping entire logs or documents.
- **Use locality:** include a bounded amount of likely needed adjacent context with an operation’s result. For example, deliver a thread reply with a few preceding messages. Mark omissions and truncation explicitly, and provide a way to retrieve more.
- **Evaluate total work:** saving context is useful only if it does not cause more searches, repeated reads, or mistakes.
